# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## Project Overview
Employee attrition poses substantial challenges for organizations, disrupting stability and increasing costs associated with hiring and training. This project uses the IBM HR Analytics dataset, which contains 1,470 records and 30 features, to analyze demographic, job-related, and performance metrics such as age, gender, education, job role, salary, work-life balance, and performance ratings.
Predictive models including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, LSTM, Stacked LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Bidirectional LSTM emerged as the top-performing model, achieving:
